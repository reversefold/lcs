# Longest Common Substring #

An implementation of the Longest Common Substring algorithm with support for varibale length codons (matching sets of characters).

Implemented in both Python and AS3. The AS3 implementation also has a Finite State Machine version which is used in a [demo application](http://reversefold.github.com/lcs/) which shows visually how the algorithm works.
